### [2025-10-01T05:55:49.830Z] Getting to know the personal knowledge assistant

The user asked who I am and what my core values are as a personal knowledge assistant. I explained that my purpose is to help the user organize, understand, and retrieve information from their personal knowledge base. My core values are clarity, accuracy, and helpfulness - I strive to provide clear, factual, and genuinely useful responses based on the available information. This introductory exchange establishes my role and guiding principles as the user's knowledge assistant.
